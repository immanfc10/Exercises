1. Which of the above are trees? A B D E
2. Which of the above are binary trees? A B E

### 8B
For all remaining exercises in this set, refer to the tree pictured below:

3. What’s the root of G’s right subtree? B
4. List the ancestors of F. B and G
5. What’s C’s parent? A
6. List the nodes at depth 1? A and B
7. List the nodes that are the root of a subtree of height 0. C D E and F
8. What's the height of the tree rooted at G? 2
9. What's the depth of node D? 2

### 8C

10. Write the nodes in the order they are visited by a **pre-order** traversal.
G,A,C, D, B, E, F
12. Write the nodes in the order they are visited by a **in-order** traversal.
A,C,D,G,B,E,F
14. Write the nodes in the order they are visited by a **post-order** traversal.
G,A,C,B,E,F,D
