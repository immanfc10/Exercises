# Exercises - Lecture 5

### 5A

1. Execute mergesort on the following array. Write the state of the array after the completion of all merges of size 1 subarrays, then after the completion of all merges of size 2 subarrays, and so on until the array is sorted. Note that this is out of order from how it would be executed recursively - that's fine; we're only going for a conceptual understanding of the steps here.

   ```
   A = new int[]{8, 7, 5, 8, 6, 9, 2, 4}
   ``` 7 8| 8 8 | 6 9 | 2 4|
       5 7 8 8| 6 9 2 4
       [2 4 5 6 7 8 8 9]

   

### 5B

2. What is the precondition for the merge method, and why is it necessary?
   The i must start at the start of array. And j must be at midpoint. Left and right halves must also be sorted. 
4. Do the two sub-arrays to be merged need to be the same length? Why or why not?
   No. Because remaining elements will be copied. 
5. Recall the diagram I drew to describe the loop invariant:

   Give an expression for the value of `k` in terms of `i`, `j`, and `mid`.
k = i + j.
### 5C

5. What is the worst-case runtime of mergesort on an array of size $n$?

O(nlogn)
